# Learn the Arabic Alphabet!

This small web app helps beginners learn the arabic alphabet. Can be used as your first step to learn the language, or read the Qur'an. I recommend going through a video playlist that teaches how the sounds are articulated.

## Features
- View the letters and their sounds at a glance
- Quiz yourself on the different letter groups
